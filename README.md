#ASCII Artinator 
###aka aart
##Introduction 
Ascii Artinator is a tool converts png images to greyscale (extended) ascii text which looks like the image.
In most cases, youl'll need a text editor with zooming support and/or really small font sizes to view the image.
On Windows, this is Notepad++ (make sure Encoding is ASCII and Character Set is Windows-1252).  I don't know what to use on other platorms.

##Building
To build the C++ code, you need Eclipse CDT with MinGW and a few supporting libraries:
libargtable2, freetype, and libpng++ (this library is just headers, no binaries).
